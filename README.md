## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Animations
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my CSS skills, particularly in:

- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Used both layout systems effectively for responsive design
- **CSS Animations**: Implemented smooth slide-in animations on page load
- **Gradients and Shadows**: Created realistic phone mockup with gradients and box-shadows
- **Responsive Design**: Built a mobile-first approach that works across all device sizes
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Used CSS variables for consistent theming

Key code highlights:

```css
/* Beautiful gradient background */
.background-gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(293, 100%, 63%) 0%, hsl(264, 100%, 61%) 100%);
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 85%, 0 100%);
}

/* Smooth animations */
@keyframes slideIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(30px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my skills in:

- Advanced CSS animations and transitions
- CSS preprocessors like SASS/SCSS
- JavaScript interactivity for chat functionality
- Performance optimization techniques
- Accessibility best practices
